## Introduction and background

![](images/paste-E79330DA.png)

-   For this case study, we are tasked to assist the marketing team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.
-   Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.
-   We have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.
-   The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.
-   We will present our analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with our high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Phase 1 - Ask

**Business Task** - Identify trends in usage of smart devices to make recommendations to marketing team for growth opportunities.\
**Key Stakeholders** - Urška Sršen, Sando Mur and Bellabeat marketing analytics team

## Phase 2 - Prepare

-   The data is stored in public domain, hosted at Kaggle by Mobius. [(Source)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)
-   **ROCCC Analysis** -
    -   Reliability - Data is crowdsourced. Acceptable.
    -   Original - The data is collected from survey data via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Acceptable.
    -   Comprehensive - The data comprises activity log ranging from seconds to days, but only for a period of 31 days. Okay.
    -   Current - Data is outdated, as it was collected between 04/12/2016 - 05/12/2016. Bad.
    -   Cited - No citations available. Bad.
-   **Integrity** - Data is collected through a survey. Unable to ascertain the integrity of data.
-   **Licensing** - Data is publicly available, crowdsourced.
-   **Privacy & Security** - There are no personal identifiers in the data. The data is tagged with 'id'.
-   **Help answer your question?** - The dataset contains data for personal habits relating to steps, calories, heart rate, sleep and weight. It can be used to explore trends.
-   **Any problems with data?** - The sample size of 30 users does not represent the entire smart device users' population. Furthermore, the dataset is 6 years old and the trends will have most likely have evolved over the years.
-   **Dataset organization** -
    -   There are 18 files in the dataset, containing data for 33 Fitbit users.
    -   Minute data x8
        -   Steps (long & wide), calories (long & wide), intensity (long & wide). **\~ maybe too specific for marketing-based insights**
    -   Hourly data x3
        -   Calories, Intensities, Steps (long) **\~ could be useful to understand what time of the day users were most active**
    -   Daily data x4
        -   Daily activity (long) - comprising of Steps + calories and intensity
        -   Calories, intensity, Steps (long)
    -   Heartrate (by seconds) data x1 **\~ maybe too specific for marketing-based insights**
    -   Sleep (by day) x1
    -   Weight log (by day) x1

## Phase 3 - Process

### Setting up environment

```{r Setting environment}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

### Importing CSV files

```{r Importing daily csv datafiles}
setwd("D:/RStudio/Bellabeat")
daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_calories <- read_csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
daily_intensities <- read_csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
daily_steps <- read_csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")

glimpse(daily_activity)
glimpse(daily_calories)
glimpse(daily_intensities)
glimpse(daily_steps)
```

-   At first glance, it seems daily_activity is a consolidated dataframe of daily_calories, daily_intensities and daily_steps. Let us verify.

```{r Checking for duplicate records - daily datasets}
dailyact_calories <- daily_activity %>% 
  rename(ActivityDay = ActivityDate) %>% 
   select(Id, ActivityDay, Calories)

data_common1 <- inner_join(dailyact_calories, daily_calories)
glimpse(data_common1)

dailyact_intensities <- daily_activity %>% 
    rename(ActivityDay = ActivityDate) %>% 
    select(Id, ActivityDay, SedentaryMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, VeryActiveMinutes, SedentaryActiveDistance, LightActiveDistance, ModeratelyActiveDistance, VeryActiveDistance)
data_common2 <- inner_join(dailyact_intensities, daily_intensities)
glimpse(data_common2)

dailyact_steps <- daily_activity %>% 
      rename(ActivityDay = ActivityDate) %>% 
  select(Id, ActivityDay, TotalSteps)
data_common3 <- inner_join(dailyact_steps, daily_steps)
glimpse(data_common3)
```

-   It can be safely concluded that daily_activity is a consolidated dataframe, comprising data from daily_calories, daily_intensities and daily_steps dataframes. We can remove the latter 3 dataframes.

```{r Importing other datafiles}
# Importing other dataframes
hourly_calories <- read_csv("hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read_csv("hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv")
sleep_day <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight_log <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")

glimpse(hourly_calories)
glimpse(hourly_intensities)
glimpse(hourly_steps)
glimpse(sleep_day)
glimpse(weight_log)
```

### Cleaning Data

#### Check for Null values

```{r Check for Null values}
sum(is.na(daily_activity))
sum(is.na(hourly_calories))
sum(is.na(hourly_intensities))
sum(is.na(hourly_steps))
sum(is.na(sleep_day))
sum(is.na(weight_log))
```

-   The 'Fat' column in weight_log has a lot of Null values.

#### Check for duplicate values

```{r Check for duplicate values}
sum(duplicated(daily_activity))
sum(duplicated(hourly_calories))
sum(duplicated(hourly_intensities))
sum(duplicated(hourly_steps))
sum(duplicated(sleep_day))
sum(duplicated(weight_log))

#Remove duplicate values from sleep_day dataframe
sleep_day <- sleep_day %>% 
  distinct()
```

#### Standardizing column names

```{r Cleaning dataframe column names}
#Cleaning dataframe column names

daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(date = activity_date)

hourly_calories <- hourly_calories %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(date = activity_hour)

hourly_intensities <- hourly_intensities %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(date = activity_hour)

hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(date = activity_hour)

sleep_day <- sleep_day %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(date = sleep_day)

weight_log <- clean_names(weight_log)
```

#### Fixing datatypes of columns

```{r Changing datatypes of columns}
# Changing datatype of date columns

daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, "%m/%d/%Y"))

## hourly_calories dataframe
#format date column from char to date-time
hourly_calories$date = as.POSIXct(hourly_calories$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")

#create new column named 'time' extracting time from date column
hourly_calories$time <- format(hourly_calories$date, format = "%H:%M:%S")


## hourly_intensities dataframe
#format date column from char to date-time
hourly_intensities$date = as.POSIXct(hourly_intensities$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")

#create new column named 'time' extracting time from date column
hourly_intensities$time <- format(hourly_intensities$date, format = "%H:%M:%S")


## hourly_steps dataframe
#format date column from char to date-time
hourly_steps$date = as.POSIXct(hourly_steps$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")

#create new column named 'time' extracting time from date column
hourly_steps$time <- format(hourly_steps$date, format = "%H:%M:%S")


## sleep_day dataframe
sleep_day <- sleep_day %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format="%m/%d/%Y"))


## weight_log dataframe
weight_log <- weight_log %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format="%m/%d/%Y"))
```

#### Final check for dataframes

```{r Final Check for dataframes}
head(daily_activity)
head(hourly_calories)
head(hourly_intensities)
head(hourly_steps)
head(sleep_day)
head(weight_log)
```

### Guiding Questions

**What tools are you choosing and why?**\
I'm choosing to work with R, as it is accessible to import, clean, process, analyze and visualize dataframes.\
**What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?**\
I have checked for null data, duplicate entries, formatted column names and fixed datatypes for date columns.\
**How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?**\
I have double-checked the data post cleaning.\
**Have you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?**\
I have documented the cleaning process for review.

## Phase 4 - Analyze

### Quick Summary Statistics

```{r Analyzing Participants in Data}
# Analyzing Participants 
n_distinct(daily_activity$id)
n_distinct(hourly_calories$id)
n_distinct(hourly_intensities$id)
n_distinct(hourly_steps$id)
n_distinct(sleep_day$id)
n_distinct(weight_log$id)
```

-   sleep_day dataframe has data for 24 and weight_log has data for 8 participants, while rest have data for 33 participants.

```{r Analyzing observations in Data}
# Analyzing no. of observations
nrow(daily_activity)
nrow(hourly_calories)
nrow(hourly_intensities)
nrow(hourly_steps)
nrow(sleep_day)
nrow(weight_log)

```

```{r Summary Statistics}
# Summary Statistics
daily_activity %>% 
  summary()

hourly_calories %>% 
  summary()

hourly_intensities %>% 
  summary()

hourly_steps %>% 
  summary()

sleep_day %>% 
  summary()

weight_log %>% 
  summary()
```

### Plotting Data

#### Relationship between Total steps and sedentary minutes

```{r Plotting Data between Total steps and Sedentary minutes}
ggplot(data=daily_activity) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=total_steps, y=sedentary_minutes, color=calories)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=total_steps, y=sedentary_minutes))
```

**Observations:**

-   No trend is observed between total steps and inactive minutes.

-   No relationship between calories burnt and inactive minutes.

#### Relationship between very active minutes & calories

```{r Plotting Data between very active minutes & calories}
ggplot(data=daily_activity) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=very_active_minutes, y=calories, color=very_active_distance)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=very_active_minutes, y=calories))
```

**Observations:**

-   A positive relation between very active minutes and calories burnt.

#### Average distribution of active minutes, by percentage

```{r Average distribution of activity by percentage}
total_sums <- daily_activity %>% 
  summarize(total_sm = sum(sedentary_minutes), total_lam = sum(lightly_active_minutes), total_fam=sum(fairly_active_minutes), total_vam=sum(very_active_minutes))

total_tm <- total_sums %>% 
  summarize(sum(total_sm, total_lam, total_fam, total_vam))

average_tm <- total_sums %>% 
  summarize(avg_sm = (total_sm/total_tm)*100, avg_lam = (total_lam/total_tm)*100, avg_fam = (total_fam/total_tm)*100, avg_vam = (total_vam/total_tm)*100)

average_tm
```

**Observations:**

-   81.3% is occupied by sedentary minutes.

-   Only 1.74% of activity is occupied by very active minutes.\

#### Relationship between total steps & calories

```{r Plotting Data between total steps & calories}
ggplot(data=daily_activity) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=total_steps, y=calories, color=total_distance)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=total_steps, y=calories))
```

**Observations:**

-   A positive relationship between total steps and calories burnt.

#### Determining the time users were most active

```{r Plotting time users were most active}
#Merging hourly datasets

hcal_mean <- hourly_calories %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_calories = mean(calories))
head(hcal_mean)

hint_mean <- hourly_intensities %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_intensity = mean(total_intensity))
head(hint_mean)

hsteps_mean <- hourly_steps %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarize(mean_steps = mean(step_total))
head(hsteps_mean)

hourly_mean <- merge(hcal_mean, hint_mean, by.x="time", by.y="time")
hourly_mean <- merge(hourly_mean, hsteps_mean, by.x="time", by.y="time")
head(hourly_mean)

ggplot(data=hourly_mean, aes(x=time, y=mean_calories, fill=mean_calories)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
ggplot(data=hourly_mean, aes(x=time, y=mean_intensity, fill=mean_intensity)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
ggplot(data=hourly_mean, aes(x=time, y=mean_steps, fill=mean_steps)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

**Observations:**

-   Participants were most active between 16:00-18:59 hours followed by 11:00-13:59 hours.

-   As expected, calories were least burnt between 23:00-04:59 hours.

#### Relationship between time in bed and minutes asleep

```{r Relationship between time in bed and minutes asleep}
ggplot(data=sleep_day) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=total_minutes_asleep, y=total_time_in_bed, color=total_minutes_asleep))
```

**Observations:**

-   A positive linear relationship is observed between total time in bed and total minutes asleep.

-   Furthermore, few participants seem to have spent a lot of time in bed but didn't asleep. The team could work to focus on sleep or insomnia related apps.

-   Out of 33 participants, 24 participants had logged their sleep activity. More marketing content towards sleep tracking features.

#### Trends with weight tracking

**Observations:**

-   Only 8 participants logged their weight in the Fitbit app, in contrast to 33 users logging their daily activities.

-   Bellabeat's app could implement push notification services to encourage users to push for increased weight tracking.

## Phase 5 - Share

### 1. Average Distribution of Active Minutes

![](images/Avg%20Dist%20of%20Active%20Minutes.png)

#### Findings:

-   Insights indicate most participants used the Fitbit app to track inactive moments such as daily work, commute etc. (approximately 81.3%).

-   Marketing could push for campaigns such as small workout sessions between work, or encourage taking small walk breaks between work or leisure hours, such as taking a walk break every 30 minutes, encouraging more users to walk and track their fitness.

### 2. Most Active Times of the Day

![](images/Sheet%201.png)

#### Findings:

-   Participants were found to be most active between evening hours of 16:00-18:59 hours burning most calories, taking maximum no. of steps, with highest intensity during this time period. 2nd most active period was around lunch hours 12:00-14:59.

-   Surprisingly, the data indicates of calories being burnt during not-so intensive inactive time periods, which was tracked by the Fitbit app.

-   It could be suggested to market efficient health tracking and calorie tracking features by fitness devices, along with benefits of how proper sleep results in burning of calories.

### 3. Sleep Tracking

![](images/Sheet%202.png)

#### Findings:

-   As anticipated, the data indicates a strict positive relationship between Total Time in Bed and Total Minutes asleep.

-   Furthermore, few participants seem to have spent a lot of time in bed but didn't asleep. The team could work to focus on sleep or insomnia related apps.

-   Out of 33 participants, only 24 participants had logged their sleep activity. Marketing strategies encompassing sleep tracking features and benefits of sleep tracking could be adopted.

### 4. Comparison of Activity Tracking

![](images/Sheet%203.png)

#### Findings:

-   While the sample size of 33 is not representative of the population, the data indicates Calorie and Sleep tracking to be the most popular Fitbit features used by participants.

-   Bellabeat's marketing strategies could be guided to encourage participants for weight tracking and its benefits.

-   As a product suggestion, Smart Weight Measuring Scales could be introduced.

## Phase 6 - Act

### Trends in Smart device usage

-   Most participants used their FitBit app to track more than 80% of the sedentary minutes.

-   Less than 3% of the time is spent in active or intense workouts.

-   Participants were most active during evening hours between 16:00 to 18:59 hours and 12:00 to 14:59 hours.

-   Step and Calorie tracking are the most popular Fitbit features. Weight tracking is the least popular feature.

### Application of these trends in Bellabeat's marketing strategy

-   Both Fitbit and Bellabeat are engaged in the digital fitness industry. Bellabeat's products could be used to encourage customers for health tracking by highlighting the benefits of smart-devices.

-   Benefits of sleep and weight tracking could be marketed with smart-watches and smart weighing scales, along with benefits of how proper sleep results in burning of calories. Proper sleep = active health.

-   Marketing could push for campaigns such as quick workouts between work, or encourage taking small walk breaks between work or leisure hours, such as taking a walk break every 30 minutes, encouraging more users to walk and track their fitness.

-   As the app is used to track more than 80% of sedentary activity, marketing campaigns highlighting, 'Why being seated for long hours is bad for health' could be strongly pushed.
